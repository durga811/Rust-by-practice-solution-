```rust

struct Unit;
trait SomeTrait {
    // ...Some behaviors defined here.
}

// We don't care about what fields  are  in the Unit, but we care about its behaviors.
// So we use a struct with no fields and implement some behaviors for it
impl SomeTrait for Unit {  }
fn main() {
    let u = Unit;
    do_something_with_unit(u);

    println!("Success!");
}

fn do_something_with_unit(u: Unit) {   }// have declare parameter as struct type
```
