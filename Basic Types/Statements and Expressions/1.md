```rust

fn main() {
   let v = {
       let mut x = 1;
       x += 2;
       x   // this is expression
   };

   assert_eq!(v, 3);

   println!("Success!");
}

```

```rust

fn main() {
   let v = {
       let mut x = 1;
       x += 2
   };//it is not a expression, so the value of v is unit type ()

   assert_eq!(v, ());// replace 3 with ()

   println!("Success!");
}

```
